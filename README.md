# MazeSnake

MazeSnake 1.1
Solve mazes, collect powerups, and build up your collection of snakes! 
MazeSnake is a 2D game in which the player (that is, you) is a snake. You try to solve as many mazes as you can, in order to collect XP and level up. However, each maze has some powerups, which will assist you in your maze-solving by allowing you to teleport, break walls, and more! You can also collect coins, which can be used to purchase more snakes or just get some powerups, as well as get XP to level up. As you progress through the game, the mazes will get harder, and eventually become timed. Your goal is to get to as high a level as possible!

Additionally, MazeSnake includes achievements. You can get these by completing mazes, collecting powerups, and grabbing coins. Achievements will reward you with coins and XP.
