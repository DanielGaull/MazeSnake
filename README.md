# MazeSnake

Simple game about solving mazes with a few different gamemodes. In Classic you race against the clock and must avoid enemies. In Freeplay, the clock and enemies are removed, so you are free to solve mazes at your own pace. Star Mode has the clock and enemies, but instead of solving the maze, you must collect all the stars. Features different powerups, and coins to buy powerups/skins. Initially developed in 2015. Created using Monogame.
